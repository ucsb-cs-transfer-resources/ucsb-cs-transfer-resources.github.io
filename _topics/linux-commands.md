Linux is the operating system that is used on the machines in Phelps 3525 and the CSIL lab.

Linux is a particular variant of the Unix family of operating systems.

The Mac operating system from version 10 onward (i.e. MacOS X) is also a Unix derived system.

Most of what you will be using related to Unix/Linux actually pertains to command line tools that you access from the bash shell. This includes commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, etc. A great way to learn about these commands is to type another command `man` followed by the desired command. ie. ` man ls ` will provide the following manual plus more:
`
ls -- list directory contents
cd -- change the shell working directory
pwd -- print name of current/working directory
mkdir -- make directories
cp -- copy files and directories
mv -- move (rename) files
rm -- remove files or directories
grep -- print lines matching a pattern
cat -- concatenate files and print on the standard output
chmod -- change file mode bits
ssh --	secure shell client (remote login program)

`

While these commands are associated with Unix, because they originally appeared on Unix systems, in fact, they have been ported to many other systems as well.  Cygwin is a package for Windows that allows users to run many programs associated with Unix on Windows systems.

You can also get many of these tools by using a bash shell for Windows such as the *git bash shell* that comes with *Git for Windows*, or the bash shell that is being provided with Windows 10.
