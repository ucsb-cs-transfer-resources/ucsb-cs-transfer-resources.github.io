If you are taking a Computer Science class at UCSB, you are definitely going to be using CSIL. 

# What exactly is CSIL and why do I need to know about it?

CSIL is the main computer system used for all classes in the CS department at UCSB. The school uses it so that everyone can write, edit, and submit code all on a single platform to prevent any debugging/compiling issues. 

Students can access CSIL by using the computers located in HFH 1140 and Phelps 3525 (this one is in a classroom and technically uses CSTL), or by ssh-ing remotely with your own computer. You must log in with your CSIL account, which can be created with the link below:


# Creating your ECI / CSIL Account

Visit: <https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/>

Once your account is running, you should be able to log into any of the CSIL computers on campus, or use CSIL remotely through ssh.

# "sshing into CSIL"

The phrase "sshing into CSIL" means to use a program to connect to a remote 

# How to access CSIL remotely/ by sshing

simple type into the command line
```
ssh username@csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu
```
*please note that the numbers "01" can be replaced by any two-digit number e.g. 02,03,44,22,23*

After you press enter, the system will ask you for your username and password for CSIL, and once that is completed you will be successfully remotely accessing a CSIl computer

PLEASE NOTE if you have a Windows computer, you have to jump through a couple more hoops. See [Command Line](/_topics/command_line) for instructions on programming through the command line

# CSIL is the system of record

Typically, professors and TAs say that your program "works" if and only if it "works on CSIL".

So, if you are working on a program on your own machine, that's fine--but make sure before you
turn it in, you test it on CSIL.
